Welcome to my GIS (Geographic Information Systems) project repository. This is a growing collection of my work in the geospatial domain, covering projects involving:

Remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis,
Spatial data visualization and cartography,
Geoprocessing using ArcGIS, QGIS, and Python,
DEM(digital elevation model),
Land use/land cover classification,
MAP digitization,

Tools and techniques:

ArcGIS,
QGIS,
ERDAS Imagine,
Google Earth Pro,
